# Most properties can be overridden with environment variables specified in this file
# Most properties also have defaults (mentioned in this file) if they are not set in either the config file or the corresponding environment variable

# to pass directly to the Go command that Athens runs under the
# hood. Athens primarily runs two Go commands:
# 1. `go mod download -json <module>@<version>`
# 2. `go list -m -json <module>@latest`
# The go command accepts multiple environment variables that
# can affect the two processes above such as GONOSUMDB and GOPROXY.
# Note that athens passes the NoSumPatterns to the two commands above,
# but the existence of GONOSUMDB in this configuration takes precedence.
# Although you can pass any key=value to the Go command here, you can see
# the list of possible env vars by running `go env`.
# Env override: ATHENS_GO_BINARY_ENV_VARS
# 
# IMPORTANT note about using the env var to override this config:
#
# You must use a semi-colon (;) to separate multiple env vars
# within ATHENS_GO_BINARY_ENV_VARS. For example:
# ATHENS_GO_BINARY_ENV_VARS='GOPROXY=proxy.golang.org,direct; GOPRIVATE=github.com/gomods/*'
# The semi-colon is here used instead of the comma (,) because the comma is a valid value to 
# separate arguments in certain go env vars such as GOPROXY and GOPRIVATE
#
# NOTE that if you use the env var, then whatever you have in this config file will be overridden 
# and NOT appended/merged. In other words, if the config file value is 
# GoBinaryEnvVars = ["GOPROXY=direct"]
# And you pass the following env var: 
# ATHENS_GO_BINARY_ENV_VARS='GODEBUG=true'
# Then the final value that the Go binary will receive is ["GODEBUG=true"] and NOT ["GOPROXY=direct", "GODEBUG=true"]
# Therefore, whether you use the config file or the env var, make sure you have all the values you need there.
