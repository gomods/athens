## Storage

The Athens proxy supports many storage types:

- [Storage](#storage)
- [Memory](#memory)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration)
- [Disk](#disk)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration-1)
- [Mongo](#mongo)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration-2)
- [Google Cloud Storage](#google-cloud-storage)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration-3)
- [AWS S3](#aws-s3)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration-4)
- [Minio](#minio)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration-5)
    - [DigitalOcean Spaces](#digitalocean-spaces)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration-6)
    - [Alibaba OSS](#alibaba-oss)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration-7)
- [Azure Blob Storage](#azure-blob-storage)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration-8)
- [External Storage](#external-storage)
      - [Configuration:](#configuration-9)
- [Running multiple Athens pointed at the same storage](#running-multiple-athens-pointed-at-the-same-storage)
  - [Using etcd as the single flight mechanism](#using-etcd-as-the-single-flight-mechanism)
  - [Using redis as the single flight mechanism](#using-redis-as-the-single-flight-mechanism)
    - [Direct connection to redis](#direct-connection-to-redis)
    - [Connecting to redis via redis sentinel](#connecting-to-redis-via-redis-sentinel)

All of them can be configured using `config.toml` file. You need to set a valid driver in `StorageType` value or you can set it in environment variable `ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE` on your server.
Also for most of the drivers you need to provide additional configuration data which will be described below.

## Memory

This storage doesn't need any specific configuration and it's also used by default in the Athens project. It writes all of data into local disk into `tmp` dir.

**This storage type should only be used for development purposes!**

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "memory"

## Disk

Disk storage allows modules to be stored on a file system. The location on disk where modules will be stored can be configured.

>You can pre-fill disk-based storage to enable Athens deployments that have no access to the internet. See [here](/configuration/prefill-disk-cache) for instructions on how to do that.

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "disk"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Disk]
            RootPath = "/path/on/disk"

where `/path/on/disk` is your desired location. Also it can be set using `ATHENS_DISK_STORAGE_ROOT` env

## Mongo

This driver uses a [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) server as data storage. On start this driver will create an `athens` database and `module` collection on your Mongo server.

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "mongo"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Mongo]
            # Full URL for mongo storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MONGO_STORAGE_URL
            URL = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"

            # Not required parameter
            # Path to certificate to use for the mongo connection
            # Env override: ATHENS_MONGO_CERT_PATH
            CertPath = "/path/to/cert/file"

            # Not required parameter
            # Allows for insecure SSL / http connections to mongo storage
            # Should be used for testing or development only
            # Env override: ATHENS_MONGO_INSECURE
            Insecure = false

            # Not required parameter
            # Allows for use of custom database 
            # Env override: ATHENS_MONGO_DEFAULT_DATABASE
            DefaultDBName = athens

            # Not required parameter
            # Allows for use of custom collection 
            # Env override: ATHENS_MONGO_DEFAULT_COLLECTION
            DefaultCollectionName = modules
## Google Cloud Storage

This driver uses [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) and assumes that you already have an `account` and `bucket` in it.
If you never used Google Cloud Storage there is [quick guide](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#storage-create-bucket-console)
how to create `bucket` inside it.

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "gcp"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.GCP]
            # ProjectID to use for GCP Storage
            # Env overide: GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
            ProjectID = "YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID"

            # Bucket to use for GCP Storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_GCP_BUCKET
            Bucket = "YOUR_GCP_BUCKET"

## AWS S3

This driver is using the [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and assumes that you already have `account` and `bucket` created in it.
If you never used Amazon Web Services there is [quick guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html) how to create `bucket` inside it.
After this you can pass your credentials inside `config.toml` file.  If the access key ID and secret access key are not specified in `config.toml`, the driver will attempt to load credentials for the default profile from the [AWS CLI configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) created during installation.

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "s3"
    
    [Storage]
            [Storage.S3]
            ### The authentication model is as below for S3 in the following order
            ### If AWS_CREDENTIALS_ENDPOINT is specified and it returns valid results, then it is used
            ### If config variables are specified and they are valid, then they return valid results, then it is used
            ### Otherwise, it will default to default configurations which is as follows
            # attempt to find credentials in the environment, in the shared
            # configuration (~/.aws/credentials) and from ec2 instance role
            # credentials. See
            # https://godoc.org/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go#hdr-Configuring_Credentials
            # and
            # https://godoc.org/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session#hdr-Environment_Variables
            # for environment variables that will affect the aws configuration.
            # Setting UseDefaultConfiguration would only use default configuration. It will be deprecated in future releases 
            # and is recommended not to use it.

            # Not required parameter
            # Env override: AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
            Token = ""

            UseDefaultConfiguration = false

            # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/credentials/endpointcreds/
            # Note that this the URI should not end with / when AwsContainerCredentialsRelativeURI is set

            # that overrides the default generated endpoint for S3 storage client.
            #
            # You must still provide a `Region` value when specifying an endpoint.
            # Env override: AWS_ENDPOINT
            Endpoint = ""

## Minio

[Minio](https://www.minio.io/) is an open source object storage server that provides an interface for S3 compatible block storages. If you have never used minio, you can read this [quick start guide](https://docs.minio.io/).  Any S3 compatible object storage is supported by Athens through the minio interface. Below, you can find different configuration options we provide for Minio. Example configuration for Digital Ocean and Alibaba OSS block storages are provided below.

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "minio"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Minio]
            # Endpoint for Minio storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ENDPOINT
            Endpoint = "127.0.0.1:9001"

            # Access Key for Minio storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            Key = "YOUR_MINIO_SECRET_KEY"

            # Secret Key for Minio storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            Secret = "YOUR_MINIO_SECRET_KEY"

            # Enable SSL for Minio connections
            # Defaults to true
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_USE_SSL
            EnableSSL = false

            # Minio Bucket to use for storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_BUCKET_NAME
            Bucket = "gomods"

#### DigitalOcean Spaces

For Athens to communicate with [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/), we are using Minio driver because DO Spaces tries to be [fully compatible with it](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/).
Also configuration for this storage looks almost the same in our proxy as for [Minio](#minio).

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "minio"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Minio]
            # Address of DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ENDPOINT
            Endpoint = "YOUR_ADDRESS.digitaloceanspaces.com"

            # Access Key for DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            Key = "YOUR_DO_SPACE_KEY_ID"

            # Secret Key for DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            Secret = "YOUR_DO_SPACE_SECRET_KEY"

            # Enable SSL
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_USE_SSL
            EnableSSL = true

            # Space name in your DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_BUCKET_NAME
            Bucket = "YOUR_DO_SPACE_NAME"

            # Region for DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_REGION
            Region = "YOUR_DO_SPACE_REGION"

#### Alibaba OSS

For Athens to communicate with [Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/oss), we are using Minio driver.
Also configuration for this storage looks almost the same in our proxy as for [Minio](#minio).

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "minio"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Minio]
            # Address of Alibaba OSS storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ENDPOINT
            Endpoint = "YOUR_ADDRESS.aliyuncs.com"

            # Access Key for Minio storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            Key = "YOUR_OSS_KEY_ID"

            # Secret Key for Alibaba OSS storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            Secret = "YOUR_OSS_SECRET_KEY"

            # Enable SSL
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_USE_SSL
            EnableSSL = true

            # Parent folder in your Alibaba OSS storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_BUCKET_NAME
            Bucket = "YOUR_OSS_FOLDER_PREFIX"

## Azure Blob Storage

This driver uses [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/) 

> If you never used Azure Blog Storage, here is a [quickstart](https://aka.ms/azureblob-quickstart)

It assumes that you already have the following:

- [An Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json)
- [The credentials (storage account key)](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key)  
- A container (to store blobs)


##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "azureblob"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.AzureBlob]
            # Storage Account name for Azure Blob
            # Env override: ATHENS_AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME
            AccountName = "MY_AZURE_BLOB_ACCOUNT_NAME"

            # Account Key to use with the storage account
            # Env override: ATHENS_AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY
            AccountKey = "MY_AZURE_BLOB_ACCOUNT_KEY"

            # Name of container in the blob storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME
            ContainerName = "MY_AZURE_BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME"

## External Storage

External storage lets Athens connect to your own implementation of a storage backend. 
All you have to do is implement the (storage.Backend)[https://github.com/gomods/athens/blob/main/pkg/storage/backend.go#L4] interface and run it behind an http server. 

Once you implement the backend server, you must then configure Athens to use that storage backend as such:

##### Configuration:
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "external"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.External]
            # Env override: ATHENS_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_URL
            URL = "http://localhost:9090"

Athens provides a convenience wrapper that lets you implement a storage backend with ease. See the following example: 


```golang
package main

import (
    "github.com/gomods/athens/pkg/storage"
    "github.com/gomods/athens/pkg/storage/external"
)

// TODO: implement storage.Backend
type myCustomStorage struct {
    storage.Backend
}

func main() {
    handler := external.NewServer(&myCustomStorage{})
    http.ListenAndServe(":9090", handler)
}
```

## Running multiple Athens pointed at the same storage

Athens has the ability to run concurrently pointed at the same storage medium, using
a distributed locking mechanism called "single flight".

By default, Athens is configured to use the `memory` single flight, which
stores locks in local memory. This works when running a single Athens instance, given
the process has access to it's own memory. However, when running multiple Athens instances
pointed at the same storage, a distributed locking mechansism is required.

Athens supports several distributed locking mechanisms:

- `etcd`
- `redis`
- `redis-sentinel`
- `gcp` (available when using the `gcp` storage type)
- `azureblob` (available when using the `azureblob` storage type)

Setting the `SingleFlightType` (or `ATHENS_SINGLE_FLIGHT TYPE` in the environment) configuration
value will enable usage of one of the above mechanisms. The `azureblob` and `gcp` types require
no extra configuration.

### Using etcd as the single flight mechanism

Using the `etcd` mechanism is very simple, just a comma separated list of etcd endpoints.
The recommend configuration is 3 endpoints, however, more can be used.
  
    SingleFlightType = "etcd"

    [SingleFlight]
        [SingleFlight.Etcd]
            # Env override: ATHENS_ETCD_ENDPOINTS
            Endpoints = "localhost:2379,localhost:22379,localhost:32379"

### Using redis as the single flight mechanism

Athens supports two mechanisms of communicating with redis: direct connection, and
connecting via redis sentinels.

#### Direct connection to redis

Using a direct connection to redis is simple, and only requires a single `redis-server`.
You can also optionally specify a password to connect to the redis server with

    SingleFlightType = "redis"

    [SingleFlight]
        [SingleFlight.Redis]
            # Endpoint is the redis endpoint for the single flight mechanism
            # Env override: ATHENS_REDIS_ENDPOINT
            Endpoint = "127.0.0.1:6379"

            # Password is the password for the redis instance
            # Env override: ATHENS_REDIS_PASSWORD
            Password = ""

#### Connecting to redis via redis sentinel

**NOTE**: redis-sentinel requires a working knowledge of redis and is not recommended for
everyone.

redis sentinel is a high-availability set up for redis, it provides automated monitoring, replication,
failover and configuration of multiple redis servers in a leader-follower setup. It is more
complex than running a single redis server and requires multiple disperate instances of redis
running distributed across nodes.

For more details on redis-sentinel, check out the [documentation](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel)

As redis-sentinel is a more complex set up of redis, it requires more configuration than standard redis.

Required configuration:

- `Endpoints` is a list of redis-sentinel endpoints to connect to, typically 3, but more can be used
- `MasterName` is the named master instance, as configured in the `redis-sentinel` [configuration](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel#configuring-sentinel)

Optionally, like `redis`, you can also specify a password to connect to the `redis-sentinel` endpoints with

    SingleFlightType = "redis-sentinel"

    [SingleFlight]
      [SingleFlight.RedisSentinel]
          # Endpoints is the redis sentinel endpoints to discover a redis
          # master for a SingleFlight lock.
          # Env override: ATHENS_REDIS_SENTINEL_ENDPOINTS
          Endpoints = ["127.0.0.1:26379"]
          # MasterName is the redis sentinel master name to use to discover
          # the master for a SingleFlight lock
          MasterName = "redis-1"
          # SentinelPassword is an optional password for authenticating with
          # redis sentinel
          SentinelPassword = "sekret"
