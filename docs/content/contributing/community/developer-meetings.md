Every Thursday, Athens developers get together for one hour on a video chat to discuss the state of the project, and any specific development topics that are going on.

We meet at this [zoom](https://zoom.us/) video Chat URL: [https://aka.ms/athensdevzoom](https://aka.ms/athensdevzoom)

>**Absolutely everybody is welcome to attend these meetings, suggest topics to talk about, share your perspective, and participate as little or much as they'd like**.
>
>You don't have to be a contributor to attend

## Meeting Details

We rotate the time of the meeting weekly, so that as many people as possible get a chance to attend the meeting at a time appropriate for their time zone. The rotation of times is below:

- Thursday on odd week numbers of each month: 22:00 UTC ()
- Thursday on even week numbers of each month: 20:00 UTC

Each developer meeting starts with a quick update on the project from the maintainers, and then we discuss things on the agenda.

>All developer meetings happen using the [zoom](https://zoom.us) software. Before you come to the meeting, please make sure you have installed the zoom client using this link: https://zoom.us/support/download.

## Agenda

The [agenda google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xpvgmR1Fq4iy1j975Tb4H_XjeXUQUOAvn0FximUzvIk/edit#heading=h.f24qbjkyfv6v)
 is where we keep track of what to talk about each week. Anybody can edit it, so if you want to talk about a topic, write it down in a bullet point under the appropriate week, and we'll talk about it if time permits. Please follow these guidelines when you add your topic:
 
- If there are already topics listed, please add yours to the bottom of the list
- If the date of the next meeting is not listed, please add it as a heading above all the previous dates. Copy the format of the previous date when you add it
 
 Here's an example of how to suggest a topic:

> * (Bob) Let’s talk about something cool!
> * (Alice) Let’s talk about cool thing #2!
