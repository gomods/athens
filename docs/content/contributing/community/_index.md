# The Athens Community

Welcome, Athenian! We've put together this section to help you get involved with the Athens community.

Before we go further, we want you to know two things:

1. You can contribute in many ways, including documentation, testing, writing code, reporting bugs, reviewing code, technical writing, and more
2. [Absolutely everybody is welcome](https://arschles.com/blog/absolutely-everybody/). You are welcome in our community, regardless of your level of programming experience, number of years writing Go, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or anything else. If you want to be here, we will do everything we can to help you feel welcome and involved


Ready to join us? Head over to the [guide on how to participate](./participating) to get started!
